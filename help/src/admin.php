<p align="left">This page is where you control the administrative options. This includes options such as which version of SmoothTorque you're using, the MySQL server settings, and the look and feel of the website.</p>

<p align="left">The first two items avaliable to you are to view the system logs and view the help pages. The system logs contain information about who has accessed what part of the system and at what time.</p>

<p align="left">The next set of settings available to you are to choose which backend you want to use. Invariably you will want to be using the Linux Backend. This panel also allows you to select where Sox (a program used for converting audio) resides.</p>

<p align="left">The next set of options are for the MySQL database. You're able to seperate off the SmoothTorque database from the CDR records. Initially they're on the same database, on the same machine. This is where you specify the login details for the MySQL server. There are two parts to these settings. The first part is for SmoothTorque to use, this database holds the numbers, campaigns and so on. The second part is for Asterisk to use for the CDR records. For the second part, you need to specify a database and a table to use.</p>

<p align="left">The next portion of the page contains information about the Licence details. When SmoothTorque is purchased, then you will be supplied with a User ID and a Licence Key.</p>

<p align="left">Following on from the licence details is the Look and Feel of the website. You're able to edit the colours used for the background and date/time. You're also able to change the title of the site, the logo displayed, and the text that appears on the opening page.</p>

<p align="left">The next portion of the admin options controls the text used for the different menu options</p>

<p align="left">The next portion of the admin options controls the text used for the different menu options. These values are self explanatory.</p>

<p align="left">The next part contains settings for the Billing Engine. By default the SmoothTorque billing engine is not used. If you wish to enable it then this is the place to enable it. </p>

<p align="left">The final part of the admin options are custom contexts. These to be used if you wish to define your own type of campaign. To do this, you will need some Asterisk experience. This is not intended for the novice.</p>
