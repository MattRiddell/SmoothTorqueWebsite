<p align="left">This allows <?echo $config_values['TITLE'];?> to schedule the start and stopping of campaign. Give it a name of a queue (this is not the same as the asterisk queues, so really anything can go here), and a description. Give it a start and stop time. Once you've done this, the campaign will run between those times of the day.</p>
