<p align="left">Agents are created as being a memeber of a queue. To create an agent you first have to create a queue. Once you're created a queue click on the <img src="/images/group_add.png"> button, this will bring up a place to enter a name, password, and codecs to use for that agent. This will create a sip account that's tied to the queue. The next step is to register a phone with the asterisk server using the name and password given. Once this is done (and asterisk -rx 'sip show peers' displays OK for the status of the agent), the agent can login by dialing 555. They are then logged in to the queue.</p>

<p align="left">If you want to create this configuration statically (i.e. in /etc/asterisk/sip.conf and /etc/asterisk/agents.conf), then that's fine too. You need not use this page to add agents.</p>
