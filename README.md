# SmoothTorque Website

The is the website and controller for the SmoothTorque predictive dialer/message broadcasting software.

It's been around for what seems like forever but has always existed in SVN rather than GitHub.

It's Open Source - GPL.  It was recently converted to bootstrap.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
